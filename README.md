This little tool will recursively browse a directory to find code 
projects in several languages. If the project hasn't been touched for 
more than a month, it will remove directories containing libraries, 
dependencies, builds, etc.

The reasoning behind this is that these files can be retrieved or 
re-generated at any time, but if you haven't worked on the project for 
a month chances are you don't need them taking up space on your hard 
drive right now.

## Install
Download the binary for your platform from the 
[releases page](https://github.com/woubuc/project-cleanup/releases)

Or install via Cargo: `cargo install --git https://github.com/nmrshll-contrib/project-cleanup`

## How it works
Run the application with `project-cleanup --help` to see the options.

## Supported languages
- Node.js (will remove the `node_modules` directories)
- Rust (will remove the `target` directory)
- Java (will remove the `.gradle` and `build` directories)

These languages are based on my own experience and use patterns. I welcome
issues and pull requests to add more languages and/or more unnecessary
directories in already added languages.
